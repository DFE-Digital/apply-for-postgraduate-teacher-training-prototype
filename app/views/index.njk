  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you’ll need</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">To be eligible for teacher training, you need these qualifications (or their non-UK equivalents):</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li class="govuk-body">a degree</li>
    <li class="govuk-body">grade 4 (C) or above in English and maths GCSEs</li>
    <li class="govuk-body">grade 4 (C) or above in GCSE science if you want to teach primary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before you start a teacher training course you’ll also need to confirm you have the health and physical capacity to start training.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have a disability</h2>
  <p>It is against the law for training providers to discriminate against teacher training candidates with disabilities or special educational needs. <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-teach-with-a-disability">Learn more</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you don’t have a degree</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can teach in further education (age 14 to adult), or study for a degree leading to qualified teacher status. <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/eligibility-for-teacher-training">Learn more</a>.</p>
