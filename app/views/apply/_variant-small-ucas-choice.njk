<p class="govuk-body">Apply for teacher training is a streamlined new GOV.UK service which is designed to make application easier. It comes with personalised support for candidates.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Is this new service right for you?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Apply for teacher training is still in development. The service will eventually replace UCAS as the way candidates apply for teacher training. However, for now, it is limited to just a few courses.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="https://www.apply-for-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/candidate/providers">preview a list of training providers and courses</a> currently available on Apply for teacher training.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">For most courses, you’ll still need to apply through UCAS.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Additionally, the service isn’t ready yet for international candidates or candidates who’ve studied outside the UK.</p>
