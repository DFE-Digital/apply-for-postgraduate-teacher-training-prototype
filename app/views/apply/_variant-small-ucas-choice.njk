<p>You can apply for this course through Apply for teacher training.</p>
<p>Apply for teacher training is a new application process designed to make it easier to apply for teacher training courses. It also offers personalised support.</p>
<p>It will eventually replace UCAS as the way to apply for teacher training.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Is this new service right for you?</h2>

<p>We’re still working on Apply for teacher training, so it might not be possible to apply to all the courses you’d like to through the service.</p>

<p>To apply to those courses you’ll need to make a second application through UCAS.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the service isn’t ready for international candidates or candidates who’ve studied outside the UK.</p>
