  <p class="govuk-body">This is particularly important if your choice of subject is different from that of your degree. Check your provider’s course listing page on <a href="https://find-postgraduate-teacher-training.education.gov.uk/">Find postgraduate teacher training</a> for their specific subject knowledge requirements.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Evidence can include:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>modules you studied as part of your undergraduate degree</li>
    <li>other tertiary qualifications (for example a Masters or Phd)</li>
    <li>your A level subjects</li>
    <li>expertise you’ve gained at work</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Providers may ask you to sit a <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/explore-my-options/teacher-training-routes/subject-knowledge-enhancement-ske-courses/">subject knowledge enhancement</a> (SKE) course to top up your subject knowledge.
