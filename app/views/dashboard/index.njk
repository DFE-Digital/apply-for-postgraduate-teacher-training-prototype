  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/courses">Your course choices</a></h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Your course details are prefilled with the selection you made in Find postgraduate teacher training. You can change your choice of provider by going back to Find and searching again. Or, you can enter new details yourself.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">When you’ve submitted your first application, you can apply to up to X other providers using this service, as long as they are opted in to our trial. For most providers, you’ll still need to apply through UCAS. When you search on Find, you’ll be guided through this process.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"><a href="/profile">Your details</a></h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">We’ll save all your personal, academic and professional details, so that you can complete your application in your own time.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">After you’ve submitted your first application, you’ll be able to tailor your details to suit subsequent applications.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll find guidance throughout the form to help you complete it. Before you begin, however, we suggest you check your eligibility and refer to our step by step guide to becoming a teacher.</p>
