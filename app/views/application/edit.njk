  <p class="govuk-body">You have 5 days after submission to edit most sections of your application and change your choice of training provider, course or training location.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">During this period, your application can only be edited and resubmitted once. If you have applied to more than one provider, you will be able to edit and resubmit each application separately.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">References</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can't edit your choice of referees unless they refuse to give a reference. We'll email you if this happens, so you can put forward a replacement referee.</p>
 <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact details</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can edit your contact details throughout the application process. Sign into your account and visit <a href="/applications">Application dashboard.</a></p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Withdrawing your application</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can also withdraw one or more application(s) at any point during the application process. You won't be penalised, but after the 5-day editing period is up, you can't substitute a different provider.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">To withdraw, please email us at <a href="mailto:becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk">becomingateacher@digital.education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
