  <p class="govuk-body">Interviews usually take place over the course of a day. You'll need to attend in person.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Your training provider(s) might not have much flexibility when setting a date and time for interview.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If there's a reason why you need some flexibility you can tell us about it here.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">For example:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>you have commitments such as employment or caring responsibilities</li>
    <li>you'll be travelling a long way to get to the interview</li>
    <li>you'll need some adjustments because you're disabled</li>
