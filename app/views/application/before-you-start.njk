  <p>Apply for teacher training is a new GOV.UK service still in development.</p>
  <p>The service will eventually replace UCAS as the way candidates apply for teacher training. However, for now, the service is limited to just a few courses.</p>
  <p><b>We suggest you choose a course first.</b></p>
  <p>In this way, you'll be able to check your course is available on the service before you fill out your application form.</p>
  <p>If you choose a course which isn’t yet available on Apply for teacher training, you’ll be guided back to UCAS to make an application.</p>
